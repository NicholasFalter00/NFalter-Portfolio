<h1>@ViewData["Title"]</h1>

<p>Ideas:</p>
<p>Change contact button at top to dropdown with phone and email?</p>
<p>Add some sort of database system (SQLite?) to store Experience and other information without just hard coding it in the Index.cshtml.cs</p>
<p>Fix the page resizing</p>
<p>Add skills and education sections (add to sidebar?)</p>
<p>Add linkedin link</p>
<b>Fix sidebar being cut off</b>

<p>This page is under construction as of @ViewData["TimeStamp"]</p>
